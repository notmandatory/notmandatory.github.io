Oops, looks like I didn't posted anything here in 2019 but in 2020 I have some fun projects on my radar that I want to write about, 
 starting with today's refresh of this blog to use [Zola](https://getzola.org) instead of Jekyll. My primary reasons for 
 switching to Zola are: 
 
 - it's written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) which is a language I want to use more this year
 - I like the directory structure and configuration, it's simpler
 - there's an easy to use GitHub action to publish new content as it's merged
 
 See the [Github page](https://github.com/notmandatory/notmandatory.org) for this site for all the details.
