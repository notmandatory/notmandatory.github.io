I've been playing around with the [jimpo/bitcoin bip157-net](https://github.com/jimpo/bitcoin/tree/bip157-net) fork
of bitcoind so I created a little docker-compose regtest network for it. Here's the link for anyone  who wants to try it. 
You can use any [bitcoin/bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) fork by changing the Dockerfile.

See my [notmandatory/bitcoin-regtest-box](https://github.com/notmandatory/bitcoin-regtest-box) repo.
