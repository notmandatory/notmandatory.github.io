I was surprised to get a message a few days ago from [Tom Harding](https://github.com/dgenr8) asking if I'd be willing to bump the version in the BitcoinXT gitian-debian apt package builder to 0.11E. I was happy to hear that the BitcoinXT project was still being maintained and that there was something I could do to help out. I made the required changes and did a quick test on the Debian 8 VM I created back in August for testing these scripts; as expected everything worked fine.  I submitted my [pull request](https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/pull/129), [Dagur Valberg Johannsson](https://github.com/dagurval) quickly tested it and the next day Tom merged it in and got on with building his new release binaries. Only about 15 minutes of my time but still rewarding and way for me to show my support for the XT effort.
